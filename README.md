### Maps created by the IEG / DigiKAR interns in 2021

This repository contains static and interactive maps as well as diagrams data tables created by digital humanities interns at IEG Mainz in 2021.
The internships were closely related to the DigiKAR geohumanities project and contributed to the analysis of spatial relations and mobility in the early modern Electorate of Mainz.

Static and interactive maps are located in the `QGIS/maps` directory. While the static maps are provided both as PNG and SVG files, the interactive maps can be viewed as websites hosted by GitHub Pages. For an overview over these pages see the guide in the `README.md` file in the `gh-pages` branch or [click here](https://github.com/ieg-dhr/Praxisprojekt2021/tree/gh-pages#readme).

A more detailed description of the repository's content and its context is available on the [corresponding website](https://teaching-dhlab.pages.gitlab.rlp.net/geburtsbriefemainz/map2/) which deals with the Geburtsbriefe in the territory of the former Kurmainz.
