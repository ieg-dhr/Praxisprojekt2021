# Praxisprojekt2021 (Digital Humanities Internship 2021)

## Overview

As part of a digital humanities internship at the Institute for European History (IEG) in Mainz, MA student Maximilian Michel created static and interactive maps as well as diagrams tracing early modern birth and apprenticeship letters from the city archives in Mainz. This internship was closely related to the [DigiKAR geohumanities project](https://digikar.eu/) and contributed to the analysis of spatial relations and mobility in the early modern Electorate of Mainz.

Static and interactive maps are located in the [`QGIS/maps` directory](https://github.com/ieg-dhr/Praxisprojekt2021/tree/main/QGIS/maps/). While the static maps are provided both as PNG and SVG files, the interactive maps can be viewed as websites hosted by GitHub Pages.

A more detailed description of the repository's content and its context in German is available on the [corresponding website](https://teaching-dhlab.pages.gitlab.rlp.net/geburtsbriefemainz/map2/), which also contains a digital edition of selected records.

## Guide to interactive maps

The `gh-pages` branch contains four interactive maps, which are hosted as static websites in this repository. They are accessible by changing the URL to the specific directories:

* [Map showing the places of issue which provides possibilities for filtering the data by gender, language, document type, date of issue and issuer category](https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_combined/index.html#5/53.251/14.136)

* [Map showing the places of issue as clusters, which provides possibilietes for filtering the data by gender and language and furthermore allows to see *all* occurrences of the particular place (instead of only the "topmost")](https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_combined_cluster/index.html#5/53.251/14.136)

* [Map showing the places of origin of people who completed their apprenticeship in Mainz and received a certificate for it](https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_distances/index.html#7/49.998/10.611)

* [Map showing the occurrences of the Geburtsbriefe's place of issue](https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_occurences_Issuer_placenames/index.html#5/49.260/13.601)

The map data were generated with the [qgis2web plugin](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) for QGIS.
