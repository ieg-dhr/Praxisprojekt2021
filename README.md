**Maps created by the IEG / DigiKAR interns in 2021**

This repository contains static and interactive maps as well as data tables created by digital humanities interns at IEG Mainz in 2021.
The internships were closely related to the DigiKAR geohumanities project and contributed to the analysis of spatial relations and mobility in the early modern Electorate of Mainz.
