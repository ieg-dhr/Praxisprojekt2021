## Guide for interactive maps in this branch

The `gh-pages` branch contains four interactive maps, which are hosted as static websites in this repository. They are accessible by changing the URL to the specific directories:

* Map showing the places of issue which provides possibilities for filtering the data by gender, language, document type, date of issue and issuer category: https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_combined/index.html#5/53.251/14.136

* Map showing the places of issue as clusters, which provides possibilietes for filtering the data by gender and language and furthermore allows to see *all* occurrences of the particular place (instead of only the "topmost"): https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_combined_cluster/index.html#5/53.251/14.136

* Map showing the places of origin of people who completed their apprenticeship in Mainz and received a certificate for it: https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_distances/index.html#7/49.998/10.611

* Map showing the occurrences of the Geburtsbriefe's place of issue: https://ieg-dhr.github.io/Praxisprojekt2021/Webmap_occurences_Issuer_placenames/index.html#5/49.260/13.601

The map data were generated with the [qgis2web plugin](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) for QGIS.
